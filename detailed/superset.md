## Experiences

**Adam's take**: I have some hands-on experience with Superset. Frankly I am surprised it has taken this long to have a good open-source option. If you have used Airflow, the "feel" of the app is very similar. It feels like stepping into an airplane cockpit. Although there are hundreds of buttons and switches, intuitively you know that you are only going to need 10 of them or so in a normal situation. The issue is--_which 10_?

Thankfully, Maxime and co have raised a bunch of money and have dozens of paid engineers working to make the product better, without abandoning the open source principles that got the whole project started.

Superset is already scaling to thousands of users at places like AirBnb and other tech giants.

So, I'm excited where this project is going, and it is already very capable. But it is early and the UX has a long way to go.
