### Methodology

This research started from Datateer's evaluation matrix of BI products and tools. We focus on two use cases, and our evaluation criteria reflects that.

1. Internal analytics and BI
2. Customer-facing, embedded analytics

Given the variety of clients we serve, we hope this is reasonably representative of your needs as well!
